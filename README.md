# Sprinting Mod for Minetest

Get anywhere faster by running. The sprint mechanic is something essential in open-world games like Minetest. So, here is the mod that allows just that: Sprinting. Sprint by double-tapping the forward key (usually **W**) or using Aux1 key (default **E**). When you are sprinting, you get faster, your Field of View changes and ground particles begin to appear behind you. Also, you jump a little higher.
